# Compilation, Usage, and opinion

Install `dotnet` as described
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian#debian-10-).

To run the "program" use `dotnet run` inside this project directory.

To create another "program" use `dotnet new console -o <projectName>`.

I am not fully convinced of this...
