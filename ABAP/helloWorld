* Apparently, it is necessary to install NetWeaver to play with ABAP. However,*
* I don't want to install NetWeaver just to play around with ABAP. So, this is*
* some copied code, that cannot be compiled (at least I guess so).*

* Write "Hello World" (see http://helloworldcollection.de/#ABAP4) *
WRITE: 'Hello World'.

* Loop over Array (see https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/de-de/abaploop_at_itab.htm)*
TYPES t_itab TYPE TABLE OF i WITH EMPTY KEY.

LOOP AT VALUE t_itab( ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ) ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>).
  cl_demo_output=>write( |{ <fs> }| ).
ENDLOOP.
cl_demo_output=>display().

* This looks odd...*
